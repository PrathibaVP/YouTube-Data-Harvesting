# YouTube-Data-Harvesting
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a MongoDB database, migrates it to a SQL data warehouse, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.
Here are the key features of my project:

ðŸ”¹ YouTube Data Collection: By providing a valid channel ID, you can retrieve detailed information about a YouTube channel, including channel details, video details, and comments.

ðŸ”¹ MongoDB Integration: The collected data can be seamlessly migrated and stored in MongoDB for further analysis and processing.

ðŸ”¹ PostgreSQL Migration: The data from MongoDB can be migrated to a PostgreSQL database, enabling powerful querying capabilities and data manipulation.

ðŸ”¹ Streamlit Dashboard: I developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to input channel IDs, fetch channel data, and perform data migration operations with ease.
